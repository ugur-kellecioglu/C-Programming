# C-Programming Language

I created this repository to give you intuition about C programming course.

You can find presentations & quizzes & labs & prelabs & homeworks that given in a semester.

If you already know some basics of C language you can challange yourself with exams etc.

Or you can just read the presentations and try them.

Hope you like and learn some stuff :)
